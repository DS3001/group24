    "The dataset used for this project consists of relevant information for determining a patient’s likelihood to experience a stroke (and if a patient experiences a stroke). Upon importing the dataset, we cleaned it by converting all non-binary and categorical variables into binary values. We used smoking_status, avg_glucose_level, age, bmi, hypertension, heart_disease work_type, and gender as the key predictors in our model to determine whether or not a patient experiences a stroke. We chose most of these variables based on the obvious health relations with stroke likelihood. After adjusting our model and running it with several other combinations for predictors, we found that work_type and gender surprisingly made our model more accurate. The table below lists and summarizes all of the relevant columns in our analysis, as well as our transformations to each variable. "

    "We had some challenges with understanding the work_type data. Since there was no proper codebook provided for this dataset, we were unclear what “children” meant. Based on context and our understanding, we figured that this was meant for stay-at-home parents. We had to clean the data by creating binaries/numerical representations of the column values. For example, continuing with work_type, the responses were “govt_job,” “self_employed,” “private,” “children,” and “never_worked.” To prepare for our analysis, we converted those values to 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. We applied this process to other categorical variables used in our model."
